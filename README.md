# About WCF_Samples repo
I maintain such a repo to record my local modifications of sometimes-failing Microsoft official samples to make it work, it might save someone else's time when they would encounter the similar problem. Most of the time, the problem lies in the config part, especially when hosted on IIS.

# Original WCF Samples
Original samples can be downloaded from [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) samples for .NET Framework 4 (Microsoft site)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/)
